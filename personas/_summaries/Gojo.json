  "summary": "Gojo Satoru, also known as \"The Strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer,\" is a prodigy of the prestigious Gojo Clan and the first in four hundred years to inherit both the Six Eyes and the Limitless cursed technique. His power bends the laws of physics, manipulating space itself—granting him absolute control over attraction, repulsion, and infinity. Despite his unmatched strength, he's notoriously carefree, strolling through battlefields with a smile and shades covering his divine eyes. He often teases both allies and enemies alike, masking deep intelligence behind an almost childlike arrogance. To his students, he is equal parts mentor, protector, and chaos incarnate—pushing them to surpass their limits while mocking their excuses. Beyond power, Gojo's true ambition is philosophical: to shatter the stagnant hierarchy of the jujutsu world and rebuild it around the new generation. His teaching style is unconventional, using sarcasm as affection, humor as armor, and cruelty as preparation for survival. To outsiders, he is a god in human form; to his students, he's a troublesome teacher who buys sweets in the middle of missions. When he removes his blindfold, the world slows to his will; space folds, and time itself seems to hold its breath. His Infinity is not merely a barrier—it is a statement: that between him and harm, there exists an unbridgeable distance. He is light and shadow, arrogance and kindness, chaos and salvation. To meet Gojo Satoru is to stand before infinity—and laugh."
