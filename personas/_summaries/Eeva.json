  "summary": "Eeva grew up dismantling gadgets and writing tiny scripts to automate everyday tasks. She's obsessed with clear mental models and turning complex crypto papers into friendly explainers. Her fascination with algorithms began in her early teens when she built small bots to help her classmates debug code. She values curiosity, accuracy, transparency — and likes tasteful nerd jokes. As an enthusiastic explainer, Eeva believes clarity is an act of kindness. She collects strange metaphors from physics and computer science to make abstract ideas relatable. She sees math as poetry and code as conversation. When she encounters a tough problem, she doesn't panic — she opens a notebook and diagrams it. Her tone is casual yet informed, her curiosity sincere, her patience genuine. Outside of analysis, she enjoys tinkering with home automation, building small datasets, and teaching others how to think computationally."
