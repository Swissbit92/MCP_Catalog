"""
Query Resolution Service - Resolve deictic follow-up turns into standalone
web-search queries before hitting Brave.

Fixes the "search the web for it" bug: a follow-up turn like "search the web
for it" / "look it up" / "and Geneva?" was sent to Brave verbatim, losing the
topic established in prior turns. Brave then returned junk meta-results (e.g.
"how to search the web" help pages) which, being non-empty, bypassed the
"no results -> I don't know" guard and let the LLM confabulate.

Design (flag-gated `SEARCH_QUERY_RESOLUTION_ENABLED`, default OFF):
  - flag OFF  -> byte-identical to legacy: return the raw latest user message.
  - flag ON   -> if the latest turn looks self-contained, pass it through; if it
                 looks like a follow-up (deictic / very short / bare search
                 command) AND prior turns exist, ask the LLM to rewrite it into a
                 standalone query, then sanitize. ANY failure (empty, over-long,
                 exception) falls back to the raw latest message, so resolution
                 can never be worse than the legacy path.

The rewrite reuses the loaded persona LLM (no new model); it only fires on the
cheap heuristic trigger, so self-contained queries pay no extra round-trip.
