# ADR-009: Layered toolkit — registry, generic web toolset, inner wisdom, skills

## Status

Accepted 2026-07-05 (operator approval). Sequenced BEFORE the ADR-008 P1
tool-brain build at the operator's direction (2026-07-05): decide what the
tool brain will call before deciding which model calls it.

## Context

The 2026-07-05 Telegram comparison against a `hermes-agent` reference
exposed not just a routing/model problem (ADR-008) but a **toolkit
poverty** problem. Verified state of the codebase:

- The general-purpose toolkit is **one tool** (`brave_web_search`),
  hardwired to `safesearch=moderate` — actively filtering for an
  explicitly uncensored adult companion. The other 7 tools are a
  domain-locked wallet/Solana cluster.
- There is **no tool registry**. Selection is hardcoded `if/elif` on
  `QueryIntent` (`tools/tool_utils.py:get_tools_for_query`); execution is
  two bespoke paths (Brave via `SearchExecutionService`, wallet via the
  `handle_wallet_query` cascade). Adding one tool today touches ≥4 files
  plus the interceptor policy and extractor schema tables. The only
  extension point built for pluggability was
  `AgenticPipeline.tool_executors` (ADR-004), gated behind
  `AGENTIC_ENABLED`. *(Historical: that pipeline was deleted 2026-07-19 —
  the registry's `executor_bindings` now fills this role. See ADR-004,
  Superseded.)*
- The lore wiki's `entity_type: capability` entries are **diegetic
  flavor**, not a skills mechanism — a real skill loader is a new
  subsystem and must use different vocabulary.
- The companion's "inner" faculties (semantic memory, facts, lore,
  emotional state) are **prefilled** into the prompt, never model-invoked.

Reference design (operator-requested): **hermes-agent** (NousResearch,
MIT). Its qualitative architecture — a self-registering tool registry,
toolset-level enable/disable, platform adapters as toolsets, and a crisp
tools/skills split ("memory stores small durable facts that should always
be in context, while skills store longer procedures that should load only
when relevant") — is the model worth copying. (Its "70+ tools / 28
toolsets" marketing figure is internally inconsistent across its own docs;
treat as order-of-magnitude.)

Research findings that bound the design (4 threads, 2026-07-05):

1. **Web**: SearXNG (Dockerized metasearch, 130+ engines, JSON API,
   categories, `safesearch=0..2` pass-through) is the most permissive and
   most private backend — the query never leaves the machine. No
   mainstream API guarantees `safesearch=off` truly disables filtering
   (Google filters regardless; Bing's API is retired); Brave with
   `safesearch=off` is the most reliably permissive commercial API. No
   dedicated adult-search API exists anywhere — loosened general engines
   are the only retrieval path. Snippets alone are insufficient grounding;
   `fetch_url` with a trafilatura→readability→jusText extraction chain is
   the single highest-leverage addition. Deep research = a **capped**
   search→fetch→gap-check loop (2–3 rounds, top 2–4 fetches) — a 14–24B
   local model cannot productively reason over 20-source sweeps.
2. **Sandbox**: for a single-user local deployment the threat is
   prompt-injection-induced misuse of legitimate tools, not sandbox
   escape. Hardened ephemeral Docker (existing pattern + `--network none`
   or allowlist proxy, read-only rootfs, `--cap-drop=ALL`, pids/mem/cpu
   caps, timeout) is the right isolation depth; Firecracker/gVisor are
   Linux-only and solve a multi-tenant problem we don't have. Structural
   capability minimization beats prompt-level restraint (arXiv 2606.13884;
   the $150K Grok wallet-drain via prompt injection is the cautionary
   precedent): **signing/write paths must never be reachable through a
   generic terminal or skills layer.**
3. **Skills**: SKILL.md progressive disclosure is an open, multi-vendor
   standard and runnable against Ollama today (OpenCode, open-skills,
   local-skills-agent), but the one field data point puts the reliability
   floor at **20B+ non-reasoning models**, and no published benchmark
   measures the tier-1→tier-2 "load this skill?" decision by model size.
   Eval-first, not assumed.
4. **Inner wisdom**: Letta/MemGPT (production precedent) is a **hybrid** —
   core memory blocks always prefilled, only *editing* and
   *archival/episodic recall* are tools (`archival_memory_search`,
   `conversation_search`, `core_memory_append/replace`). The hypothesis
   that tool-invoked recall reduces voice homogenization is mechanistically
   consistent with our own Gate-0/M1 findings but **not directly
   benchmarked anywhere** — it is a well-motivated bet requiring an
   eval-first gate. Generative-Agents-style reflection is
   harness-scheduled, not model-invoked (sidesteps "model never calls it").

## Decision

Adopt a **layered toolkit architecture** — few powerful generic
primitives in a real registry, skills later on top, structural gating for
anything irreversible. Five components, phased:

### 1. Tool registry (foundation — Phase R)

A new `tools/registry.py` modeled on hermes-agent: each tool registers a
**definition** (existing OpenAI-function dict convention), an **executor**
callable, a **policy** entry (`mcp_access` key, `blast_radius`,
`requires_hitl` — feeding the ADR-004 interceptor instead of its private
`_TOOL_POLICY` table), and an optional **result formatter**. Tools group
into **toolsets** (`web`, `wallet`, `memory`, later `terminal`) that
enable/disable as units and gate per-persona via the existing `mcp_access`
mechanism. The registry feeds: (a) the legacy paths, (b) the ADR-004
agentic pipeline's `tool_executors`, and (c) the future ADR-008 tool
brain. Existing brave + wallet tools migrate into it; `get_tools_for_query`
becomes a registry lookup. This dissolves the 4-file-per-tool tax.

**Per-persona toolkit subsets (operator decision 2026-07-05).** Each
persona declares its own toolset grants — a first-class generalization of
the existing `mcp_access` mechanism, gated at the **toolset** level (not
per-tool: per-tool grants across 7 personas is unmaintainable config
sprawl). Persona JSON grows a `toolsets` field (e.g. E.E.V.A.:
`["web", "memory", "wallet"]`; Aegis: `["web", "memory"]`; Nyx:
`["memory"]`; Gojo: `[]`), with `mcp_access` kept as a deprecated alias
during migration. The interceptor re-checks grants independently
(defence-in-depth, unchanged from ADR-004).

**NSFW as a cross-cutting persona capability flag — not a separate
toolset.** A per-persona `nsfw: true|false` modulates granted toolsets
rather than duplicating them:

- **Web**: sets the persona's safesearch *floor* — an `nsfw: true`
  persona defaults to `off`; an `nsfw: false` persona is clamped to
  `moderate`+ regardless of the model's per-call argument (the clamp is
  enforced in the executor, not the prompt).
- **Inner wisdom**: gates access to the **intimate memory partition**
  (below).

Honest scoping note: on a single-operator machine where every persona runs
the same uncensored model, per-persona NSFW gating is **character
integrity and data hygiene, not a security boundary** — it keeps a
productivity persona from surfacing bedroom content mid-worksession and
keeps intimate data out of contexts where it homogenizes voice; it does
not (and need not) stop the operator from anything.

### 2. Generic web toolset (Phase W — first user-visible payoff)

Backend: **SearXNG in Docker as primary** (JSON format enabled, limiter
tuned for single-user; reuses the established `docker run` MCP pattern),
**Brave API as fallback** engine. `BRAVE_SAFESEARCH` and a new
`WEB_SAFESEARCH_DEFAULT` become real config (**default `off`** — this is
a private adult companion; the current hardwired `moderate` is a bug for
this product), with `safesearch` also exposed as a per-call tool argument
(`off|moderate|strict`) so the model can tighten per query.

Tools (all generic — no bespoke weather/finance/wikipedia tools; search +
fetch reaches them all):

| Tool | Params | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `web_search` | query, category (general/images/videos/news/science/files), safesearch, time_range, max_results | SearXNG primary → Brave fallback |
| `fetch_url` | url, mode (markdown/text/raw) | trafilatura → readability-lxml → jusText chain; one consent/age-gate redirect retry |
| `image_search` / `video_search` / `news_search` | query, safesearch, time_range | thin category wrappers over `web_search` |
| `extract` | url_or_text, instruction | LLM summarize/extract, separate from raw fetch |

Plus a **capped deep-research orchestration** (not a tool): ≤2–3 rounds of
search→fetch(top 2–4)→gap-check→synthesize with citation tracking through
the existing CitationService. Explicitly NOT built: crawler, maps, finance
tools (the trading repos' MongoDB/CCXT stack owns that data — a second
source of truth is a bug), multi-agent research supervisors.

### 3. Inner-wisdom toolset (Phase I — partial conversion, eval-gated)

Follow the Letta hybrid, not a wholesale tools conversion:

- **Convert to model-invoked tools**: episodic/archival recall —
  `memory_search` (semantic RAG over past conversations; wraps the
  existing bge-m3/FAISS memory), `conversation_search` (FTS over session
  history), `lore_search` (wraps existing hybrid lore retrieval as an
  invocable alternative to per-turn injection where sensible). These
  attack the always-present context bulk that ADR-006 showed dilutes
  voice.
- **Keep prefilled** (per-persona `<remembered>` framing per ADR-006 M1):
  core profile facts, emotional/PAD state (no evidence anywhere supports
  affect-as-a-queryable-tool), the persona identity itself.
- **Reflection**: harness-scheduled (Generative-Agents pattern), never a
  model-invoked "reflect_now" tool a small model would simply not call.
- **Intimate memory partition (operator decision 2026-07-05 — NSFW inner
  wisdom).** Adult-relationship continuity is inner-wisdom data: intimate
  RP history, expressed preferences, boundaries/limits, relationship-arc
  facts. It lives in the SAME stores (memory rows / `memory_facts`) with a
  **`sensitivity` tag written at ingestion** (`standard | intimate`;
  tagged by the existing async extraction worker, with the write-time
  classifier erring toward `intimate` on uncertainty) and is **filtered at
  the data layer** — the retrieval queries behind `memory_search` /
  `conversation_search` and the prefill assemblers exclude `intimate` rows
  for personas without the `nsfw` flag. Enforcement lives in the
  repository/query layer, never as a prompt instruction (a prompt-level
  "don't mention" is theater a small model will eventually violate).
  Boundaries/limits facts are the priority content class: a companion
  that forgets stated limits is a safety bug, not a memory bug.
- **Gate**: the voice-homogenization benefit is an unbenchmarked
  hypothesis — ship behind a flag with the ADR-005/006 attribution eval
  (pre/post, full 7 personas) before any default-ON. The sensitivity
  partition additionally gets characterization tests pinning that
  `intimate` rows never appear in a non-nsfw persona's retrieval or
  prefill.

### 4. Terminal/code-exec tool (Phase T — later, structurally gated)

One `run_code` tool executing in **hardened ephemeral Docker**:
`--network none` by default (per-call allowlist proxy when a skill
genuinely needs egress), read-only rootfs + tmpfs scratch,
`--cap-drop=ALL`, `--pids-limit`, memory/CPU caps, hard timeout, no
volume mounts, **no env/secret propagation ever**. Registry policy:
`blast_radius=high`, `requires_hitl=True` initially (propose→confirm→
execute card, the existing wallet-write pattern), member of
`ALWAYS_BLOCKED_FROM_AGENT` for `source="agent"` until a dedicated
red-team eval (ADR-004 M6 pattern) passes. **Wallet signing remains
structurally unreachable from this tool and from skills, permanently** —
capability minimization, not prompt-level restraint.

### 5. Skills — SKILL.md (Phase S — last)

Adopt the Agent Skills open standard for procedures (deep-research
playbook, site-specific research etiquette, later trading-report
formatting): `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`, tier-1 metadata always
in context, tier-2 body loaded on demand. New vocabulary "skills" kept
strictly distinct from lore "capabilities" (diegetic). **Skills may
orchestrate tools but never grant capabilities** — the registry policy
layer, not skill text, decides what can execute. Gate: an eval of the
tier-1→tier-2 loading decision on the chosen local model (the 20B+
reliability-floor caveat), before any skill can influence a
`requires_hitl` action.

### Sequencing (supersedes the ADR-008 P1 ordering)

**R → W → (re-enter ADR-008 P1: split-vs-single model eval against the
real web toolset) → I → T → S.** Rationale: the model eval is only
meaningful against a genuine multi-tool surface (operator decision
2026-07-05, "toolkit design first"); inner-wisdom and terminal each carry
their own eval/red-team gates; skills last because they presuppose both a
rich toolset and a validated loop driver.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: adding a tool becomes one registration instead of a
  4-file scatter; the companion gains a genuinely generic, uncensored,
  privacy-preserving research capability (queries never leave the machine
  on the SearXNG path); grounding improves (fetch + citations vs
  snippet-only); ADR-004's middleware gains a single policy source of
  truth; ADR-008's eval becomes realistic; a principled path to skills
  without betting safety on them.
- **Negative / costs**: a new always-on Docker service (SearXNG) to
  operate (engine bans/CAPTCHA churn are normal — expect to tolerate
  degraded engines); registry migration touches the interceptor/extractor
  tables (must stay behavior-identical for existing tools — regression
  suite required); fetch_url adds real latency per fetched page on local
  inference; more model-invoked tools = more silent-skip failure surface
  on small models.
- **Risks / premortem**: *This could fail if* (a) the registry migration
  silently changes interceptor policy for an existing wallet tool —
  mitigated by characterization tests pinning current allow/deny behavior
  before migration; (b) SearXNG's per-engine safesearch inconsistency
  frustrates the NSFW use case — mitigated by Brave-`off` fallback and
  engine curation; (c) memory-as-tools ships on vibes — blocked by the
  eval-first gate; (d) the terminal tool becomes an injection vector —
  blocked structurally (network-none, HITL, no secrets, signing
  unreachable).

## Alternatives considered

- **Path A — many bespoke function tools** (get_weather, get_news, …):
  rejected. Doesn't scale (per-tool schema context cost, 4-file tax),
  never composes, and contradicts the measured lesson that search+fetch
  reaches everything a bespoke read-only tool would.
- **Path B pure — terminal + skills only, minimal tools**: rejected for
  now. The token-efficiency argument is real (Anthropic: −78.5%), but it
  buys efficiency by pushing free-text judgment onto exactly the model
  size where reliability is unproven, and it concentrates blast radius in
  the single most dangerous tool. Terminal arrives Phase T, gated.
- **Wholesale memory-as-tools (pure MemGPT-2023 paging)**: rejected —
  even Letta abandoned it for the hybrid; prefilled core memory is
  load-bearing for persona voice.
- **Commercial deep-research APIs / hosted sandboxes (E2B, Firecrawl
  cloud)**: rejected — sends queries/code off-machine, violating the
  local-first privacy stance that motivated local models in the first
  place.
